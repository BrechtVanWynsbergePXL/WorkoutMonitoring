# WorkoutMonitoring
This application is a WIP. When more features are implemented, this application will make it possible to track / monitor your workouts. It will do this by generating statistics aggragated from data you put in.

By uploading your training data, this application will provide you with statistics about your previous performances. It will make it possible to keep track of the amout of sets, reps and weights you did. The app will also provide you with the option to review your previous workouts per day, week or month.
